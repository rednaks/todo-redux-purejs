Redux Todo App with Custom Elements
-----

This is a modified version of the Redux Todo App that uses Custom Elements ([MDN Custom Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements "MDN Custom Elements")).

I wanted to apply what I learned about Custom Elements on a basic project, and the Redux Todo App was the perfect one as it used only Javascript to implement the elements but in the old way. So I migrated it to the new standard to be more elegant and modern.

The paragraph below is the original author statement:

> I have no idea how to use it or how it works, so I decided to make a Proof Of Concept

> to create modular and structored webapps.


How to run:

Clone the repository and open `index.html` on your browser. that's it, no package manager, no build tools, just a browser.

Or if you're using Chrome, launch a simple Python 3 web server from the terminal while you're in the directory:
```bash
python -m http.server 8100
```
